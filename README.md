# Byron Katie Bot Demo

## Description

I started this project as a learning activity for natural language processing (NLP). Having developed an interest in the applications of conversational AI in mental health, I decided to create Lucy; a chatbot designed to lead the user through a therapeutic process called the Byron Katie method.
