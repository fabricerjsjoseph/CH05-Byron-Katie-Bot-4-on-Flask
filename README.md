# Byron Katie Bot Demo

## Description

I started this project as a learning activity for natural language processing (NLP). Having developed an interest in the applications of conversational AI in mental health, I decided to create Lucy; a chatbot designed to lead the user through a therapeutic process called the Byron Katie method.

The project is still at an infancy stage. ‘She’ is not yet capable of having organic conversations and is only able to respond to limited range of user’s utterances.
