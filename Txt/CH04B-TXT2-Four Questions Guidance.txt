Be still and ask yourself whether that thought is true... there is no right or wrong answer here....
Now ask yourself again, are you 100 % sure that it's true? Just answer what feels true for you at this moment
Notice how you feel? What happens internally when you believe that thought?
What happens when you don't believe in that thought? How do you feel?
